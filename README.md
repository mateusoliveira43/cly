# About the Template

In the project's folder, run with your machine Python 3 command
```
[python|python3] ./scripts
[python|python3] ./scripts -h
[python|python3] ./scripts --help
```
to display the script's help message.

Run the script with Python 3 command is optional. You can run the script with
```
./scripts/__main__.py
```

If you do not have permission to run it in your Linux's system, run
```
chmod +x ./scripts/__main__.py
```
to grant run permission to the file.

- To change **script name**, change line 11 of `/scripts/__main__.py`.
- To change **description** message, change line 12 of `/scripts/__main__.py`.
- To change **usage** title, change line 4 of `/scripts/config.py`.

Begin script's logic at function `main` (line 59) of `/scripts/__main__.py`.
