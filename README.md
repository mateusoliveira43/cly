# About the Template

In the project's folder, run with your machine Python 3 command
```
[python|python3] ./script_name
[python|python3] ./script_name -h
[python|python3] ./script_name --help
```
to display the script's help message.

Run the script with Python 3 command is optional. You can run the script with
```
./script_name/__main__.py
```

If you do not have permission to run it in your Linux's system, run
```
chmod +x script.py
```
to grant run permission to the file.
